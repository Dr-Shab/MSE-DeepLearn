# MSE-DeepLearn

Exercises and Solutions for the module TSM_DeLearn.
Remarks:	
  - Avoid groups of just 1 person => People concerned are asked to get together in groups of 2-3 people asap. before PW 2			
	- Only 1 person of each group submits only 1 ZIP archive containing all the exercises for the entire group (otherwise we will randomly choose which version we correct)			
	- Before to make the Zip archive (and not another format please), please name your folder containing all the exercises as follows: G##_StudentName1_StudentName2_StudentName3, where ## is the group number			
	- Write the names of all members of your group in the header (i.e. at the beginning) of each submitted jupyter notebook
